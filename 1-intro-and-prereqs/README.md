# Azure Serverless Workshop

This workshop will take you through building a personal assistant bot end-to-end.  You will get experience in working with Serverless Functions (Azure Functions), Workflows (Azure Logic Apps), Data (Azure CosmosDB) and more.  

Here's a few tools you should have installed:

1.	An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
2.	Node.js and npm https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3.	Visual Studio, either:
    * Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 with the Azure workload installed (Windows)
    * Visual Studio Code with the C# extension (Mac/Linux/Windows)
4.	Bot Framework Emulator.
    > NOTE: There's a problem with the latest Mac installers. So, install the older release botframework-emulator-3.5.19-mac.zip. The emulator will automatically download updates when it launches, and you simply have to restart it once that is complete.  

5.	If running on a Mac/Linux, .NET Core 2.0  
6.	If running on a Mac/Linx, install azure-functions-core-tools@core from npm. See https://aka.ms/func-xplat for more details.
7.	Azure Storage Explorer
8.	Azure CLI 2.0
9.	RESTful Client that will help you test the functions both locally and when deployed to Azure. One option is Postman https://www.getpostman.com/
